In accordance with Clean Water Act section 205(j)(3), unless a waiver request is approved by EPA, the recipient will jointly develop workplans with and provide at least 40% of this award to regional or interstate watershed management planning agencies.   This agreement is supported by funding provided under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (PL 117-58).  Activities:The activities to be performed by the Coastal Bend and Bays Estuary Program (CBBEP) include the following water quality management planning activities: continuation of the Nueces Delta environmental monitoring, Baffin Bay watershed modeling, nutrient sampling in Petronila Creek, installation of Mission River water quality station, seagrass monitoring in Corpus Christi and Upper Laguna Madre, and a Coastal Bend Regional Wastewater feasibility study.  The following is more detail for the above projects: Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring - CBBEP The purpose of this project is for the contractor to continue maintaining one current real-time salinity monitoring station on the Rincon Bayou. The salinity sensor will be used to trace freshwater inflows from freshwater pumping events via the Rincon Bayou Pipeline from the Nueces River and will report water temperature, conductivity, and salinity every 30 minutes. Data from this salinity station is being used to aid in the development of a management strategies for the Rincon Bayou Pipeline. The Center for Coastal Studies, the Harte Research Institute (HRI) at Texas AandM University Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) use the salinity data provided from the salinity stations to support various projects involving sampling in the Nueces Delta. Data from these salinity stations are also utilized by the University of Texas (UT) at Austin and the UT Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas to support various modeling projects which are investigating the interactions between water in sediment and tidal creeks in the Nueces Delta. The Nueces Delta Hydrodynamic Model being conducted by UT also utilized the tide gauge data in the western Nueces Bay. Several TWDB funded projects have and currently are utilizing the available data. The Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring Project supports the Program Elements 11 a., 11 b., 11 g., 11 h., and 11 i. of the March 31, 1994 106/604(b) Guidance Memo issued by EPA Headquarters. This established monitoring effort supports the 1995 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (then Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission) Agreed Order which established the protocols for the required freshwater releases to the Nueces Estuary. By supporting ongoing operation of fixed salinity gauge and meteorological monitoring stations in the Nueces Delta as well as a sea level monitoring station in Nueces Bay, this project monitors the effectiveness of freshwater inflows to the Nueces Estuary and provides data necessary for adaptive management recommendations made by the Nueces Estuary Advisory Council (NEAC). The water level monitoring station also supports National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Corpus Christi PORTSreg; monitoring network, a decision support tool that improves the safety and efficiency of maritime commerce and coastal resource management through the integration of real-time environmental observations. Data generated by this project is near real-time and is made publicly available via the NOAA Tides and Currents and the Texas AandM University - Conrad Blucher Institute websites and annual reports are published on the CBBEP website.

In accordance with Clean Water Act section 205(j)(3), unless a waiver request is approved by EPA, the recipient will jointly develop workplans with and provide at least 40% of this award to regional or interstate watershed management planning agencies.   This agreement is supported by funding provided under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (PL 117-58).  Activities:The activities to be performed by the Coastal Bend and Bays Estuary Program (CBBEP) include the following water quality management planning activities: continuation of the Nueces Delta environmental monitoring, Baffin Bay watershed modeling, nutrient sampling in Petronila Creek, installation of Mission River water quality station, seagrass monitoring in Corpus Christi and Upper Laguna Madre, and a Coastal Bend Regional Wastewater feasibility study.  The following is more detail for the above projects: Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring - CBBEP The purpose of this project is for the contractor to continue maintaining one current real-time salinity monitoring station on the Rincon Bayou. The salinity sensor will be used to trace freshwater inflows from freshwater pumping events via the Rincon Bayou Pipeline from the Nueces River and will report water temperature, conductivity, and salinity every 30 minutes. Data from this salinity station is being used to aid in the development of a management strategies for the Rincon Bayou Pipeline. The Center for Coastal Studies, the Harte Research Institute (HRI) at Texas AandM University Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) use the salinity data provided from the salinity stations to support various projects involving sampling in the Nueces Delta. Data from these salinity stations are also utilized by the University of Texas (UT) at Austin and the UT Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas to support various modeling projects which are investigating the interactions between water in sediment and tidal creeks in the Nueces Delta. The Nueces Delta Hydrodynamic Model being conducted by UT also utilized the tide gauge data in the western Nueces Bay. Several TWDB funded projects have and currently are utilizing the available data. The Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring Project supports the Program Elements 11 a., 11 b., 11 g., 11 h., and 11 i. of the March 31, 1994 106/604(b) Guidance Memo issued by EPA Headquarters. This established monitoring effort supports the 1995 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (then Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission) Agreed Order which established the protocols for the required freshwater releases to the Nueces Estuary. By supporting ongoing operation of fixed salinity gauge and meteorological monitoring stations in the Nueces Delta as well as a sea level monitoring station in Nueces Bay, this project monitors the effectiveness of freshwater inflows to the Nueces Estuary and provides data necessary for adaptive management recommendations made by the Nueces Estuary Advisory Council (NEAC). The water level monitoring station also supports National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Corpus Christi PORTSreg; monitoring network, a decision support tool that improves the safety and efficiency of maritime commerce and coastal resource management through the integration of real-time environmental observations. Data generated by this project is near real-time and is made publicly available via the NOAA Tides and Currents and the Texas AandM University - Conrad Blucher Institute websites and annual reports are published on the CBBEP website.

IN 2016, A COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION STUDY WAS FACILITATED BY THE MIDLAND AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY (MATS) TO EVALUATE AND BUILD ON THE REGIONÂ  S CURRENT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, RESPOND TO CURRENT COMMUNITY NEEDS, AND PROMOTE CONNECTIVITY COLLABORATION. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 2016 STUDY WAS TO COMBINE COUNTY CONNECTION AND CITY OF MIDLAND DIAL-A-RIDEÂ  S DISPATCH AND SCHEDULING SERVICES IN AN EFFORT TO ALLOW FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN COMBINING TRIPS. SINCE THE 2016 TRANSPORTATION STUDY, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CHANGES WITHIN THE REGION THAT HAVE GENERATED RENEWED INTEREST IN THE CONCEPT OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN AGENCIES. AS MIDLAND LOOKS TO THE FUTURE, PART OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN IN THE REGION IS TO DEVELOP TRANSPORTATION OFFERINGS THAT CAN HELP ATTRACT ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE AREA, STRENGTHEN THE SERVICE OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO CURRENT RESIDENTS, KEEP COSTS TO RESIDENTS EFFECTIVE AND FURTHER REGIONAL TRANSIT RESPONSIVENESS AND CONNECTIVITY. RESIDENTS RESIDING WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF MIDLAND CURRENTLY PAY TWO DIFFERENT TAXES TO SUPPORT THE TWO (2) TRANSIT SERVICES. A PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES SUPPORT THE CITY DIAL-A-RIDE SERVICE, AND THEY PAY A SEPARATE MILLAGE TO SUPPORT COUNTY CONNECTION. THIS PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY IF COST SAVINGS COULD BE ACHIEVED. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDY WILL HELP TO DETERMINE IF REDUCTION OF DUPLICATIVE SERVICES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TRANSIT OFFERINGS FOR THE RESIDENTS IN MIDLAND COUNTY. IF A TRANSIT AUTHORITY PROVES TO BE TOO COST PROHIBITIVE THE STUDY COULD HELP TO IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH THE SEPARATE TRANSIT AGENCIES COULD COLLABORATE WITHIN THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_MI-2022-037_6955/,2022-10-12 16:19:23+00

In accordance with Clean Water Act section 205(j)(3), unless a waiver request is approved by EPA, the recipient will jointly develop workplans with and provide at least 40% of this award to regional or interstate watershed management planning agencies.   This agreement is supported by funding provided under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (PL 117-58).  Activities:The activities to be performed by the Coastal Bend and Bays Estuary Program (CBBEP) include the following water quality management planning activities: continuation of the Nueces Delta environmental monitoring, Baffin Bay watershed modeling, nutrient sampling in Petronila Creek, installation of Mission River water quality station, seagrass monitoring in Corpus Christi and Upper Laguna Madre, and a Coastal Bend Regional Wastewater feasibility study.  The following is more detail for the above projects: Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring - CBBEP The purpose of this project is for the contractor to continue maintaining one current real-time salinity monitoring station on the Rincon Bayou. The salinity sensor will be used to trace freshwater inflows from freshwater pumping events via the Rincon Bayou Pipeline from the Nueces River and will report water temperature, conductivity, and salinity every 30 minutes. Data from this salinity station is being used to aid in the development of a management strategies for the Rincon Bayou Pipeline. The Center for Coastal Studies, the Harte Research Institute (HRI) at Texas AandM University Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) use the salinity data provided from the salinity stations to support various projects involving sampling in the Nueces Delta. Data from these salinity stations are also utilized by the University of Texas (UT) at Austin and the UT Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas to support various modeling projects which are investigating the interactions between water in sediment and tidal creeks in the Nueces Delta. The Nueces Delta Hydrodynamic Model being conducted by UT also utilized the tide gauge data in the western Nueces Bay. Several TWDB funded projects have and currently are utilizing the available data. The Nueces Delta Environmental Monitoring Project supports the Program Elements 11 a., 11 b., 11 g., 11 h., and 11 i. of the March 31, 1994 106/604(b) Guidance Memo issued by EPA Headquarters. This established monitoring effort supports the 1995 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (then Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission) Agreed Order which established the protocols for the required freshwater releases to the Nueces Estuary. By supporting ongoing operation of fixed salinity gauge and meteorological monitoring stations in the Nueces Delta as well as a sea level monitoring station in Nueces Bay, this project monitors the effectiveness of freshwater inflows to the Nueces Estuary and provides data necessary for adaptive management recommendations made by the Nueces Estuary Advisory Council (NEAC). The water level monitoring station also supports National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Corpus Christi PORTSreg; monitoring network, a decision support tool that improves the safety and efficiency of maritime commerce and coastal resource management through the integration of real-time environmental observations. Data generated by this project is near real-time and is made publicly available via the NOAA Tides and Currents and the Texas AandM University - Conrad Blucher Institute websites and annual reports are published on the CBBEP website.
